      "In this text, the author reflects on their experience taking an online course. They mention that everyone in the class was able to complete three assignments, which they feel prepares them well for the final exam. The assignments were diverse and covered either process calculus or energy optimization in programming languages, which the author finds challenging as they are unrelated to their own topic. The author suggests that organizing the assignments in a more coherent manner would make the course more engaging and motivating, as it is demotivating to prepare for and give feedback on assignments that are far removed from one's own topic. Despite this, the author found the course to be effective overall, even though it was conducted online.\n",

      "1. Organize assignments more coherently: One of the students found the assignments to be unrelated to their topic, which made them less motivated. By organizing the assignments in a more coherent manner, you can help students see how each assignment is related to their overall learning goals and make the course more engaging.\n",
      "2. Emphasize relevance: Since some students found the assignments unrelated to their topic, consider emphasizing how each assignment is relevant to their learning goals. This will help students see the purpose of each assignment and motivate them to complete them.\n",
      "3. Provide clear instructions: Some students may have found the assignments challenging due to unclear instructions. Make sure you provide clear instructions for each assignment and make yourself available to answer questions or provide clarification as needed.\n",
      "4. Encourage interaction: Since the course was conducted online, it's important to encourage interaction among students. Consider incorporating group discussions, peer review, or other interactive elements into the course to help build a sense of community among students.\n",
      "5. Continuously evaluate and improve: Finally, continuously evaluate your teaching methods and look for ways to improve. Ask students for feedback regularly and make changes as needed to ensure that the course is effective and engaging for all students.\n",

      "\"Vejledning går godt selvom på teams. Julie is great. It was helpful to get a profile of each leader before choosing which one we wanted for our project. Leader Timothy is very knowledgeable and has a good background for our project. The project framework of creating a physical product is exciting and challenging in a new way. Some students found it helpful that there were no thematic restrictions. Niels van Berkel is a great leader who gives constructive feedback and pushes us further when we need it. It's nice to work on an interactive design project. It's also nice not to have sustainability as a restriction, as it's a broad and complex theme. It would be good to spread the projects with sustainability a bit more across the curriculum. Our leaders are doing a good job. If possible, all leaders should be former AAU students. The project theme is spacious. Leaders make a big effort. The idea of multiprojects and the whole larger collaboration between multiple groups is very good, it allows us to delve into scrum and creative features on GitHub. GIRAF is a great project. It's good that we got ownership of the project to start with and could steer it as we saw fit. It was also nice to get an introduction to both the customer and process- and PO-groups from last semester. Our leader is fine, but sometimes it's hard to see where we should use him. It was fun to work on a real project and try to work with legacy code. From GIRAF: It's great that we have a lot of freedom over our project (this is compared to other projects in the semester) and it's made it easier for us to set our own direction. It's been really helpful to hear from the other groups and learn what they're working on. The collaboration has been good across the groups, despite some leaders not always knowing what the project entails.\"In this text, students evaluate their course experience on a mechatronics project. They mention that the kick-off meeting and handover meeting were fine, aligning with learning objectives. They also mention the freedom to structure and choose the project's curriculum in a high degree. It is exciting to work in collaboration with another group, but there is a greater focus from mentors to ensure proper communication and collaboration. The mentor is nice, and problem analysis is good. The big project works well, but there was chaos during grouped development, but it worked well in the end. There is a good connection between the project and ASE and DBS, but not as much with MI. The project has been very exciting and challenging. The first few days of group formation were good, and the group was able to quickly address any issues that arose. However, there were some difficulties with component selection, as the process was complicated and difficult, and some components were lost during transportation for unknown reasons. It seems that it would have been easier for everyone involved if there had been a basic set of components available to students and they could have supplemented with extra components through ordering, which would have also helped because they do not know many of the components. It appears that they should have learned this knowledge, but they have not received any training beyond a brief overview of selected components in an RTII course. Therefore, they could have ordered general components at the beginning of the project and allowed students to experiment with them instead of having issues now.Here is a summary of the text in 285 tokens or less:\n",

      "\"Evaluation of course: Some things were missing from the intro meeting, and there were problems with what should be presented. KNOX project is chaotic, disorganized, and uncoordinated. Communication between coordinator and team leaders was lacking. Information given to different groups was often contradictory. Only one thing was agreed upon by all group leaders: the need for a research paper focusing on research and theory. This goes against the study plan, which is focused on collaborative work across groups. Most group leaders advised creating isolated projects that are independent of other groups. There was a lack of structure and clear guidelines from both coordinator and team leaders. In a new multiproject, it is important for coordinator's expectations to be communicated to groups. Groups tried to contact coordinator to clarify confusion, but they didn't have time to coordinate the project. The project coordinator should have been the scrum product owner. There was some confusion in the group formation, especially with the original mail about clusters. However, there was a lot of flexibility on the day of the project, and many had their wishes regarding groups. However, it was not the most coronavirus-friendly way (but oh well). The decision to divide frontend and backend work did not have an impact on the project. Some ideas for collaboration between groups could be presented at the kickoff meeting. It is known that some things are clearly collaborative, such as... Communication with other groups was difficult because some stopped responding. The server was down in the first sprint, but there were some from the previous semester who were helpful. It was frustrating to be promised a GPU server, but only have access to it one month before the project was due. Overall, delivery was incomplete with both the coordinator and earlier groups.\"Based on the course evaluations, there are several areas of improvement for the ASTEP project. Firstly, it was noted that the guidelines provided were too complex and difficult to understand. Secondly, it was mentioned that the project timeline was unbalanced and did not provide enough time for each component. Additionally, it was suggested that the kurser in the semester were not relevant to the project and that the agile method used was not well-explained. Finally, it was noted that the Nordjyske kontaktperson (external stakeholder for the Knox project) was unable to communicate or understand English and was unable to help with the project. Recommendations included starting the kickstart of the project slightly earlier, providing a common guideline for the project, and allowing students to choose their own Git tools.\n",

The lectures on MS Teams function well, but it would be beneficial if they were recorded so students could review them later. There are good study activities and resources for students, but the quality of teaching is also high. The group found that the course started off well with early introductions to the essentials of the subject. Live lectures were decent, but there were some planned events that did not materialize. Team undergraduate courses have been adequate, and leadership has generally followed Corona restrictions and recommendations. The group found that they had good collaboration and communication, and that many things learned in DTG could be seen directly in the code they wrote.

      "* The collaboration between courses and the project, as well as user-centered design, was lacking.Based on the course evaluations, there are several areas that could be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Streaming and camera setup: The streaming quality and camera setup were not good enough, leading to a poor viewing experience.\n",
      "2. Group formation: The groups were formed randomly, without any prior coordination or communication among students. This resulted in a lack of social interaction and collaboration among group members.\n",
      "3. Practical relevance: Some students felt that the course did not provide enough practical relevance or hands-on experience with the projects.\n",
      "4. Lack of introduction to Cassiopeia: There was no proper introduction or orientation to the Cassiopeia platform, making it difficult for students to navigate and find the information they needed.\n",

      "6. Inadequate communication: The lack of clear communication among group members and the instructor resulted in confusion and misunderstandings.\n",
      "7. Lack of events: There were no social events organized for the different groups, which hindered collaboration and social interaction among students.\n",
      "8. Limited coordination: The semester schedule was too packed, with little time left for group work and projects.\n",
      "9. Insufficient information: Some students felt that they did not have access to enough information about the course requirements and expectations.\n",
      "10. Poor timing: Some students found the scheduling of events and group meetings to be inconvenient or clashing with other commitments.The course evaluations highlight several issues with the education system. Firstly, the way groups are formed is described as \"chaotic\". It would be better to have only one day to complete a group project instead of the current process. The rest of the evaluation focuses on the Object-Oriented Programming (OOADI) course, which has had few lectures and no dedicated time for mini-projects. This lack of time has made it difficult to assess how much time should be devoted to the mini-project.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluations also mention that the Database Systems (DBS) course is overpacked with lectures and assignments compared to other courses, which makes it hard to see the connection between OOADI and the rest of the semester. It has been challenging to understand the lack of experience in a low-level programming language like Java at the start of the semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluators suggest that creating groups from scratch based on the course theme would be beneficial, as it is important for a group to function socially. They also mention that some students are interested in Object-Oriented Programming while others have questions about conventions. The project is considered interesting, but the evaluators find it unfortunate that DEB and SU are not the most interesting courses due to their heavy focus on design.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evaluations express frustration with the university's inconsistency in various aspects of the semester, including group formation and exam planning. The lack of clarity regarding the responsibility for missing individuals in the final stages of group formation is also mentioned. The evaluators note that the education is voluntary, and adults should take responsibility for themselves. However, due to the pandemic, it has been challenging to maintain the social environment.\n",
      "Act. result: Based on the course evaluations, there are several areas where the instructor could improve:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Streaming and camera setup: Improve the streaming quality and camera setup to provide a better viewing experience for students.\n",
      "2. Group formation: Develop a more structured approach to group formation, such as conducting icebreaker activities or providing orientation sessions to help students get to know each other better.\n",
      "3. Practical relevance: Provide more hands-on experience with the projects and ensure that the course content is relevant to the project work.\n",
      "4. Introduction to Cassiopeia: Offer a comprehensive introduction to the Cassiopeia platform, including how to use it effectively and find the information students need.\n",
      "5. Limited accessibility: Ensure that all students have equal access to the course content, regardless of technical issues or other challenges.\n",
      "6. Inadequate communication: Improve communication among group members and the instructor by setting clear expectations and providing regular updates on project progress.\n",
      "7. Lack of events: Organize social events or activities that promote collaboration and social interaction among students.\n",
      "8. Limited coordination: Review the semester schedule to ensure that there is adequate time for group work and projects, without overloading students with too many commitments.\n",

      "Sum. result: The university handled the Chinese virus situation well this semester. Clustering is better than not being allowed access to the university's vicinities. Dimitrios was jovial. The initial status seminar was good, but it could have been improved with an opponent group where students can read each other's texts. The organization of the PP course has been good so far. The teaching assistants helping with questions are a positive addition to the course. The courses are spacious and have a high academic level. The combination of courses and electives this semester was excellent. The project and choice of electives were well-coordinated. However, there were some administrative problems during the semester, including late publication of literature, late announcement of exam dates, and unclear communication regarding P0 requirements. The university's handling of the Corona situation could be improved, as the hybrid mode does not work well for online participants, and the clustering system did not work effectively.Here is a summary of the text in 1000 tokens or less:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Students generally liked the course, but felt that there was too much theory and not enough time for discussion.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Increase face-to-face interaction: While students appreciated the theory-heavy course, they felt that there was not enough time for discussion. Consider incorporating more group activities or in-class discussions to encourage collaboration and engagement.\n",
      "2. Improve klynge system: The klynge system was not used effectively after the initial few weeks. Consider providing clearer instructions or promoting its use throughout the course.\n",
      "3. Offer virtual opportunities: Some students wished there were more virtual opportunities from the start. Consider offering additional online content or activities to support remote participation.\n",
      "4. Provide more corona-related information: Students felt that there was a lack of information provided about Corona and the university's handling of the situation. Consider providing regular updates on the university's website or through email communications.\n",
      "5. Implement hybrid mode improvements: While the hybrid mode was well-intentioned, some students found it challenging to participate online. Consider making adjustments to the hybrid mode to improve the online experience for all participants.\n",
      "6. Offer web programming course: Some students requested a web programming course before the semester began to make it easier to participate remotely if needed. Consider offering this course in the future or providing additional resources on web development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the feedback suggests that the instructor could improve the course by increasing face-to-face interaction, improving the klynge system, offering more virtual opportunities, and providing more information about Corona. By addressing these areas of concern, the instructor can enhance the student experience and better support their learning goals.\n",

      "Sum. result: Timothy works hard to connect students and administration, but it seems like things are not going well. Despite this, we appreciate Tim's efforts and communication across the course. We are happy to have a shared design studio and a group room. The course structure provides a good balance of math, methodology, and design. The projects are well-structured, and online learning has been good. Thomas' MI underwriting and implementation of tools in other courses are impressive. The virtual learning experience improved this semester compared to last. Agile software engineering fits well with the projects this semester, and there is less reading than last semester. It's great to be physically present in the group room and lecture halls. However, the planning for this semester seems worse than last semester, and mechatronics should not be part of the curriculum. The rules regarding digital and physical teaching prevent some students in quarantine from following the coursework. As students, we cannot understand why there is no recording of the coursework for those in quarantine. Mechatronics was disappointing, as it did not teach us more about components, despite being planned after the course. This confusion persists, and generally, it seems like things are not going well.The university's policies regarding COVID-19 and related restrictions have a significant impact on students and teaching. Students are advised to stay home if they are only slightly sick, but it seems that they will be penalized if they follow this advice, as there are no digital teaching options available except for uploaded slides that may not always be up-to-date or relevant to the course. In some cases, there is a huge difference between attending classes and watching slides from home, as the slides often contain key terms and concepts that are important for understanding the subject matter. Clusters are difficult to coordinate for lectures, and even when they are coordinated, there is a risk of sitting too close together. A possible solution is to attend classes every four weeks instead of every two weeks. Carsten held some good virtual lectures that worked better than hybrid lectures, as the lecturer often did not see or hear what was said on Zoom, or forgot to repeat questions. Hire people who are not too focused on following along in class and can actually participate in the discussion. It would be great if software could have access to other locations besides those available on FRB7G. The buildings are generally not very pleasant to work in, and ventilation is too loud to use while sitting there. The fact that the building was supposed to be torn down just before software moved in is quite concerning. The university's handling of the Corona situation has not been optimal. There has been no handling of how to work together in groups, and it is a problem that the university does not have the option to hold things online, but instead insists on physical activities. We do not feel that the latest management group meeting report fully covers what was presented by the critic. In particular, the argument for more self-governance in DBS seems inadequate in the report. Some of the sound from the local studios was not audible over Zoom, and it would be great if someone could look at the sound and adjust it so it is not so bad (FRB 7H, aud). Management group meetings should not interfere with other activities in the schedule. Regarding psychological well-being, it would be great if coronainformation came out earlier. The semester is functioning.Based on the course evaluations, there are several areas of concern:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lack of communication and organization at the beginning of the study circle, leading to chaos and poor feedback.\n",
      "2. Insufficient feedback is not taken seriously, and instead of addressing it early on, it is pushed aside for more urgent matters.\n",
      "3. There is a lack of transparency and clarity in the agile methodology, making it difficult for students to take it seriously.\n",
      "4. The group lacks understanding of how to work with complex backends, and there is uncertainty about whether they are meeting 100% of the requirements.\n",
      "5. Relevant projects andmail from ITS were found to be irritating, and there was a lack of coordination in the mail sent to students.\n",
      "6. The construction of the lecture hall on Novi 9 has inconvenient windows that require climbing or kneeling to reach, and only people over 1.90m can access the handrails.\n",
      "7. There is a perceived discrepancy between the project and courses in the semester, with the former being irrelevant and the latter not being used properly due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n",
      "8. The use of qualitative methodology in the project, despite being the only course used, is seen as unplanned and detrimental to the project's chances of success.Here is a summary of the text in 500 tokens or less:\n",

      "\"It was pleasant to have SAD before the 4th semester project. Our table disappeared when the cleaning lady locked our group room. We prefer if all lectures are recorded as much as possible, as it's hard to follow along when lying in bed with Corona. Technical issues also made online lecturing suboptimal, which supports the first point. The database course is coming late in the curriculum. It would have been helpful to learn about it earlier. We think it's unfair that lectures aren't recorded, forcing all students to follow along as usual. This goes beyond our student discipline, as those with no discipline will also be affected.\"\n",
      "Act. result: As an actionable feedback bot, I would summarize the course evaluations and provide feedback to the instructor in the following areas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Communication and organization: Improve communication channels at the beginning of the study circle to avoid chaos and ensure timely feedback. Establish a clear organizational structure and define roles and responsibilities to prevent confusion.\n",
      "2. Feedback: Take student feedback seriously and address it promptly. Provide regular feedback throughout the course to help students understand their progress and identify areas for improvement.\n",
      "3. Agile methodology: Clarify the agile methodology and provide adequate support to help students understand and implement it effectively. Ensure that students have a clear understanding of the project requirements and how to meet them.\n",
      "4. Complex backends: Provide guidance on how to work with complex backends and ensure that students are meeting all requirements. Offer additional resources or support if needed.\n",
      "5. Mail and notifications: Improve coordination in sending mail and notifications to students. Ensure that important information is communicated clearly and promptly.\n",
      "6. Lecture hall design: Address the inconvenience of the lecture hall design by providing alternative seating options for students of different heights or by adjusting the handrails to be more accessible.\n",
      "7. Project relevance: Review the project and course alignment to ensure that they are relevant and aligned with student needs. Provide additional resources or support if needed to help students complete the project successfully.\n",
      "8. Qualitative methodology: Reconsider the use of qualitative methodology in the project and explore alternative approaches that may better align with student needs and expectations.\n",

      "The course was well-organized and had good content, but there were some issues with the delivery. The video lectures were helpful, but the audio quality could be improved. The flipped classroom approach was effective, and the use of slides and video was good. However, some students found the video lengths to be too short, and the lack of interactivity in the videos was a drawback. The course evaluation overall was positive, with students enjoying the flexibility of being able to review the material anytime they wanted. Some students preferred live (virtual) lectures over video lectures, while others had the opposite preference. The use of Balsamiq Wireframes and Prezi slides were also appreciated by some students.The course has several issues according to student evaluations. Firstly, the video quality is poor, with many students finding it difficult to follow along due to low audio and video quality. Additionally, the assignments are repetitive and lack variation, leading some students to feel that they are not learning anything new. Some students also felt that the course did not provide enough physical lessons, making it feel disconnected from the semester. The Prezi slides as video lectures were found to be difficult to follow, and students preferred using PowerPoint instead. Furthermore, students felt that the book was too expensive and did not provide enough information for the price. Finally, some students found it unclear who had said certain concepts and their names were not mentioned enough.Here is a summary of the text in 400 tokens or less:\n",

      "* The flipped classroom approach did not improve the learning outcomes for the students.\n",
      "* There was a lack of clarity in the course design, including unclear instructions and insufficient time for completion of assignments.\n",
      "* Students found it difficult to understand what was important in each chapter of the required book due to its complex layout and lack of clear design rules.\n",
      "* The exam format did not directly reflect the course content, with students being required to answer questions based on reflections and justifications rather than multiple-choice options.\n",

      "* It would be beneficial to provide information on exam format, submission deadline, and expected time spent on the final project.\n",
      "* Some students found the lack of information on these topics confusing.The lecturer's teaching method is confusing and fast-paced, making it difficult for students to follow. He talks too quickly and doesn't explain the code he's writing, which creates a disconnect between what he's saying and what he's doing. The live coding was nice, but he often gets out of touch with his keyboard, resulting in confusion for the audience. The lecturer has a poor attitude towards students, expecting them to be docile and uninterested from the beginning. He spends a lot of time telling us how we're supposed to learn everything without any depth or explanation. The assignments are unclearly formulated, requiring a lot of time to understand and take away from learning the new concepts. Some members of the group feel that assigning homework from the previous week is not a good format. They suggest creating the assignments based on the lecture they just had, so they can relate them to what they learned. The lack of visual aid in the lectures was disappointing. Overall, the course evaluation suggests that the lecturer's teaching method needs improvement.Here is a summary of the text in 285 tokens or less:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The course evaluations expect clear instruction on how to solve problems as part of the course solution.\n",
      "* Exams should be announced in advance, giving students more than 7 days to prepare.\n",
      "* There have been occasional vague explanations for why certain things cannot be done/used, and more concrete answers are desired.\n",
      "* An assignment was given during this course, but there was no feedback. More assignments with feedback are wanted.\n",
      "* The lecturer focused on good coding style instead of teaching how to program, which did not come through in the instruction.\n",
      "* The pace of the lecture was slow, and it would be better with PowerPoint slides to clarify where students were in the lesson.\n",
      "* Thomas is not always good at learning from his mistakes.\n",
      "* It is difficult to understand his teaching style at times, and he often goes off on tangents by the end of the lesson.\n",
      "* The formulation of the material is not the best, and much of it is shown during live coding parts of the lesson, which can be confusing for students who are not familiar with how things hang together.\n",
      "* Live programming: difficult to follow, and he often runs out of time by the end of the lesson.\n",
      "* Upload: Forced to learn new material every day, and it is hard to keep up.\n",
      "* Assignments: Unclear assignments, making it difficult for students to know what they are expected to do and how much thinking they need to do themselves. Students have a lot on their plates, both for other tasks and the exam. The exam preparation did not go well as it was held before the lecture and students were not motivated to attend. The lecturer also struggled with some questions and did not meet the goals of the lesson. The exam task is poorly described and does not give students enough freedom to implement their own solutions. The use of words like \"child\" should be avoided in the task description. The exam task takes too long to complete and is too big, requiring extensive programming. Students were not informed about the time frame for the task and the size is therefore problematic. It would be good to give students more time to work on the task and to provide smaller tasks that are related to the exam task. Live coding led to many side effects and interruptions. Instead, video explanations could be used. There were some subjective elements in the lectures without proper explanation. The time management was poor, with too much time spent on irrelevant questions. The tasks were difficult to complete within two hours, and the lack of increasing difficulty made it hard for students to stay focused. The book was difficult to understand, and there was a lot of additional explanations that were hard to relate to. More focus should be placed on allowing students to take ownership of their solutions.Students have provided feedback on the course, including suggestions for improvement. Some of the key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The slides were better than live programming, as they were more structured and easy to follow.\n",

      "* The course materials are not available on Moodle.\n",
      "* Assignments were thrown onto GitHub without proper explanation or clarification, making it difficult for students to understand the best solutions.\n",
      "* It would be beneficial to have larger projects that students could work on to apply their knowledge of OOP and C#.\n",
      "* The course is a bit superficial, and undergoing more in-depth explanations and practical examples would improve the course.\n",
      "* There should be clearer communication about the time available for the exam assignment.\n",
      "* The course is a bit overly focused on SU, and more attention could be given to implementing Design Patterns in C#.\n",

They can imagine the video recordings from the lectures, which were taken, allowing them to see places they fell off due to many questions. The videos went well likely because the teacher wasn't interrupted during the presentation. The practical aspects of the exam assignment are unclear. It was only the day before delivery that we received information about the time frame and deadline. This made it difficult to plan ahead without feeling unnecessary pressure. It would be nice to have video recordings of the lectures, which could help those who struggle with the course for exam preparation and general understanding of the course elements.

      "The literature is good at explaining concepts, but it would be better if the assigned reading were more tailored to individual lectures rather than multiple lectures. Klikker is a good idea, but it would be better if online participants could also participate. The quizzes are good, but it would be better if they could be used for repetition as well. Christian and Katja's questions are not too difficult, but it would be better if they didn't sound so easy. The mini-project was fine, but the introduction to practical database use was not good enough. Too many files, no explanations on how to do things. The topics were gone through at too low a level, so that everyone could follow. The assignments are unclear. It would be better if the practical part were introduced earlier (e.g., DDL and then practical tasks such as creating tables, etc.). The quizzes under the lecture are good because people can learn anonymously, but online participants cannot participate. The Moodle quizzes are good, but they are easily forgotten. The teachers know what they're talking about, the assignments are well-formulated, and there is enough material for learning the course content. The slides are fine, and the quizzes are good too. It's fine that the answers to the assignments come after the deadline, but it would be better if they came before. The normal assignment registration was good, and the interactive component with polling questions was good for engaging the students. There were plenty of assignments with good support most of the time. Here is a summary of the text in 333 tokens or less:\n",

      "* There is a general feeling that the course is very controlled.\n",
      "* We are no longer responsible for our own learning, but rather become students who are told what to do and when.\n",
      "* Examples of solutions include quizzes that can only be taken during the lecture and cannot be made up later, and solutions that are not available for review before the lecture.\n",
      "* The combination of physical and virtual lectures does not work well due to reduced interaction between students who are in different locations.\n",
      "* Technical problems can make it difficult to hear the online students, and there is frustration with the lack of ability to review quizzes after they have been locked.Students evaluate the course and express several concerns:\n",

      "1. Lack of flexibility in accessing quizzes: Students wish they could access quizzes at their own pace, rather than being limited to a specific week.\n",
      "2. Quizzes are locked after a certain period: Students cannot access previously answered quizzes, which can be frustrating when they want to review or brush up on material before an exam.\n",
      "3. Three instructors lead the course, resulting in a lack of coherence and consistency across lectures.\n",
      "4. Technical aspects of the course material are too detailed and time-consuming to read.\n",
      "5. Lecture slides do not always match the lecture content, making it difficult for students to follow along.\n",
      "6. Students would benefit from a more detailed reading guide to avoid spending too much time on irrelevant material.\n",
      "7. It would be helpful if hjælpleærere had prepared tasks before they arrived, so they could provide better assistance during the exercise session.\n",
      "8. The \"self-study\" module (module 4) was not as helpful due to the lack of support from the quizzer group. Students find online lectures frustrating due to lack of interaction and feedback. Practical exercises could be introduced earlier in the course. It is difficult to test queries without being able to see them in practice. The consent for recording may not be effective, as in MI, where students can opt-out at the beginning of the lecture. Having three different course holders results in a different character and starting point for the course. Students find it hard to get feedback on their assignments, and there are many self-study exercises that do not work well. A possible solution could be setting an overall goal for these exercises and communicating it clearly. For example, students could make database relations schemes before being given the task of creating a database based on those schemes. Then, they could have two or three self-study exercises where they would have to write queries on their own opsatte database. The tutors can sometimes appear too calm and unhelpful, and they should be careful not to overwhelm the students. Some assignments are too repetitive, and the course's scope seems too small. Including more theoretical content on how it works internally, as well as optimization of queries and similar topics, could be beneficial. Gabriela was difficult to hear on Zoom, and one of the tutors took a long time to respond to questions. However, there were some assignments that were too repetitive. It is good to have many query exercises, but when they are so repetitive, it can become tiresome.Here is a summary of the text in 333 tokens or less:\n",

      "2. Locked quizzes: Students express frustration with locked quizzes, as they cannot access previously answered quizzes for review. Consider unlocking quizzes after a certain period or providing a way for students to make up missed quizzes.\n",
      "3. Coherence and consistency across lectures: With three instructors leading the course, there may be a lack of coherence and consistency in the material presented. Consider establishing clear learning objectives and a consistent structure for each lecture to help maintain consistency.\n",
      "4. Technical aspects of course material: Some students find the technical aspects of the course material too detailed and time-consuming to read. Consider breaking down complex concepts into simpler, more manageable chunks or providing additional resources for students who need extra support.\n",
      "5. Lecture slides not matching lecture content: Students may have difficulty following along with the lecture due to mismatched slide content. Consider reviewing and updating your lecture slides to ensure they accurately reflect the material presented in each lecture.\n",
      "6. Self-study module: Some students found the self-study module (module 4) less helpful due to a lack of support from the quizzer group. Consider providing additional resources or support for students participating in the self-study module.\n",

      "Sum. result: The course aims to make the theoretical material more accessible and easier to retain through practical representations. The lectures contain updated and relevant content. The use of the blackboard has been effective in helping students understand algorithms when reviewed. However, due to the corona pandemic, there are some deviations from the usual courses, such as figuring out attendance models for online and physical classes, and accommodating students with symptoms who cannot physically attend. While the course is larger than usual, it is not hybridized due to a lack of formal process. This resulted in difficulties in organizing clusters in auditoriums, as later arrivals had trouble finding available zones not yet taken by another cluster. The literature is outdated (which the teachers have also pointed out), and it can be challenging to follow what one teacher says, as they speak with a strong accent and a unique pronunciation. There could be more use of the blackboard for supplementary explanations through illustrations, such as algorithms. The course has been mainly online in the final part of the period due to corona-related absences. This has been an issue once when a group member couldn't attend due to a delayed Corona test response.\n",

      "1. Availability of God underviser: It is great to hear that your students have access to a god underviser. However, it would be helpful to provide more information on how to use this resource effectively. Consider providing guidelines or tutorials on how to utilize the god underviser for maximum benefit.\n",
      "2. Engagement and willingness to help: While some students may have struggled with your engagement and willingness to provide extra time for help, it is essential to ensure that all students feel supported throughout the course. Consider providing more structure or guidelines for how students can request help or clarify expectations around availability and response time.\n",
      "3. Preparation of COMTEK: It is encouraging to hear that COMTEK was better prepared for the course. To build on this success, consider providing additional resources or support for students who may be struggling with the material.\n",
      "4. Expectations for prior knowledge: Some students found the course challenging due to unrealistic expectations of prior low-level programming knowledge. To address this, consider providing a more detailed syllabus or learning objectives that outline the specific skills and knowledge required for each module. This can help manage student expectations and ensure they are adequately prepared for the coursework.\n",
      "5. Transition to Java: Several students found the transition from Python to Java challenging, particularly when it came to multi-threading and networking concepts. To address this, consider providing more context or background information on these topics before introducing them in the course. This can help build a stronger foundation for students and make the material feel less overwhelming.\n",
      "6. Relevance of topics: Some students struggled to see the relevance of certain topics, such as threading and networking, to their studies. To address this, consider providing more real-world examples or case studies that illustrate how these concepts can be applied in practice. This can help make the material feel more meaningful and relevant to student interests.\n",
      "7. Python experience: Some students expressed frustration with transitioning from Python to Java while learning object-oriented programming principles. To address this, consider providing more guidance on how to approach this transition or allowing students to choose which programming language they prefer to work in. This can help reduce the sense of discomfort or confusion that some students may have felt during the course.\n",
